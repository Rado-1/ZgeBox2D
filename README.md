# ZgeBox2D

**ZgeBox2D** is a 2D physics library for [ZGameEditor](http://www.zgameeditor.org) (ZGE). It is created as a wrapper for [Box2D](http://box2d.org), an open-source 2D physics engine for games. The main purpose is to adapt the original C++ interface to the type system of ZGE. ZgeBox2D can either be compiled as a Windows DLL or as an Android shared library. Physics-aware ZGE projects refer to the ZgeBox2D as an external library.
